# Global Demographics Analysis


## NOTE
- Interacting with the Dashboard on Tableau Public is slow due to the high volume of data used. It is best to check out how it works via the demo.

## Description
- A Tableau Dashboard animated visualisation of the life expectancy and fertility rate of countries from 1960 - 2013. 
- Made using Tableau Desktop. 
- The dataset used is from [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/). 

## How it Works
- The countries are formatted as bubbles and colour-coded by region. The size of the bubbles indicates the size of the population. 
- Fertility rate is on the x-axis and life expectancy is on the y-axis. 
- As the years progress, the fertility rate declines and life expectancy increases for many countries.
